# MðŸ‘€D â€“ Figma Connect

Connect a Figma frame to a [MðŸ‘€D Ritual](https://m00d.tech/) Stable Diffusion IMG2IMG AI Image-gen canvas.

# Instructions

1. Download the code and open index.html
2. Open MðŸ‘€D Ritual
3. Create a Figma Personal Access Token, the default settings should work, we only need "File content: Read-only", paste it into the "Figma Token" textbox
4. Select the frame you want to connect to MðŸ‘€D, press the Figma Share button, check "Link to selection", paste this intop the "Figma Share Link" Textbox
5. Hit connect and wait a few seconds, now as you change things in Figma they should update across to MðŸ‘€D as long as this script is open.

# Limitations

Needs to be restarted to reconnect to a different frame currently.
